Additional notes:
	
	- Maybe to much logic within the Messages-Ctors. ( matter of taste :) )
	- Can not use the DbContext for multi accessing. Mabye try to create a copy of the DbContext and after an action discard this copy.
	  I will need this in order to not have to use the locking statement.
	- Some bool's within the Server are not used. They can be used to check if the Server response was successful.
	- Add ConnectionFailedCallBack to FowaMetadata and raise this event on FowaClient.
