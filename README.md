**Introduction**

----------
For me the main reason for writing this application was that I am concerned with WPF and network programming. In relation to WPF I also wanted to learn more about the MVVM Pattern. One more important part in this Project plays asynchronous programming. This is my first Projekt  in which grappling with this issue. Therefore, I would be very grateful if you could give me feedback. I still want to learn a lot about this and other topics, and I hope you can help me to accomplish that.

*But now let's talk about FOWA !!*

**What's FOWA ?**

FOWA is an Instantmessenger. I plan to publish FOWA for multiple platforms, including the popular smartphone operating systems. Hence it is very Important to seperate the different applications layers so that in the best case only the UI needs to be replaced. But this is less important for the Server rather for the Client hence I used the CodeBehind files for the Server. In the backend works a MySql database which I can access through EntityFramework.
For clean data access I have implemented the repository pattern. I also wrote my own XML and TCP-based protocol.

I hope we will be able to

as soon as possible.
